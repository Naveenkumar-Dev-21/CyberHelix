## üéØ Example Workflows

### Complete Network Assessment
1. Type: "Perform a complete pentest on 192.168.1.0/24"
2. AI will execute:
   - Network discovery scan
   - Port scanning
   - Service enumeration
   - Vulnerability detection

### Web Application Testing
1. Type: "Test website https://example.com for vulnerabilities"
2. AI will execute:
   - Technology detection (whatweb)
   - Vulnerability scanning (nikto)
   - Directory enumeration (gobuster)
   - SQL injection testing (sqlmap)

### Mobile App Analysis
1. Upload APK file using üìé button
2. Type: "Analyze the uploaded APK"
3. AI will execute:
   - APK information extraction
   - String analysis for API keys
   - Permission analysis
   - Security checks

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start
- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
- Check that tkinter is available: `python3 -m tkinter`
- Verify the script has execute permissions: `chmod +x pentest_gpt_fixed.py`

### Commands Not Found
- Install missing tools using package manager
- Tools are optional - core functionality works without them
- Check PATH environment variable

### UI Issues
- Ensure X11 forwarding is enabled (if using SSH)
- Try updating tkinter: `sudo pacman -S tk`
- Check display settings: `echo $DISPLAY`
